Six Knights problem:

There are six knights on a 3 Ã— 4 chessboard: the three white knights are
at the bottom row, and the three black knights are at the top row. Exchange
the white knights with the black ones and the black knights with the white ones in the
minimum number of knight moves, not allowing more than one knight on
a square at any time.
